I'm a self-taught Senior Full Stack Developer with a keen interest in the ever-changing world of web development. During my 6-year journey in the JavaScript ecosystem, I developed my skills in front-end and back-end development. While I am well versed in both fields, I am more drawn to the challenges of back-end development.
